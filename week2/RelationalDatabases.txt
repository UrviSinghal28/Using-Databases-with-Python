#Relational Databases model data by storing rows and columns in tables.

# Database: contains many tables

# Relation (or table): contains tuples and attributes

# Tuple (or row): a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or music track

# Attribute (also column or field): one of possibly many elements of data 
# corresponding to the object represented by the row

#SQL is the language we use to issue commands to the databse:
    -Create a table (C)
    -Retrieve some data and read (R)
    -Insert data and update (U)
    -Delete data (D)
